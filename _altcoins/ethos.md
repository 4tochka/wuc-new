<center><img src="/images/ethos-102.jpg" alt="what is ethos"></center>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>This <a href="/introduction-bitcoin-paper-wallets-cold-storage/">next generation digital wallet</a> will be the backbone for Their asset management and investment services platform. The Universal Wallet will allow us to aggregate people and transactions together in dynamic ways in order to increase liquidity and keep costs down for consumers. </p>

<p>This infrastructure also allows us to create a universal mobile payment system for users who wish to transact in any currency, instantly breaking down barriers towards mass adoption in the industry. In this section They will outline the pieces of the Ethos Platform that will make it the most user-friendly way of storing, buying and sharing cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p>The Ethos platform has three main components:</p>

<p><b>Ethos Universal Wallet</b> This includes a decentralized wallet management system allowing for the easy transfer of value anywhere in the world. The Ethos Universal Wallet links seamlessly with the fiat and diversification layer.</p>

<p><b>Fiat and Diversification</b> This system includes a unique legal structure with a fiat/ diversification system whose capabilities are amplified by the Ethos liquidity network tokens.</p>

<p><b>Social and Community</b> The Ethos platform seeks to connect novices and experts and reward those who help to educate others. The platform will be a fun and friendly place to learn and begin interacting with cryptocurrencies within dynamic public and private clusters, building on the strong existing Ethos community.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With Ethos</h2>

<h4>Financial Freedom, Simplified. Introducing the Ethos SmartKey.</h4>

<p><b>Generate once, let it take care of the rest.</b> Safely and securely. A single 256-bit seed, 24-word mnemonic provides master encryption for all of the private keys in each wallet you create. Security forever.</p>

<p><b>Shake, shake, shake it out.</b> Ethos SmartKeys leverage user feedback and accelerometers to ensure your SmartKey is one of a kind and ultra secure. Who said state-of-the-art security can’t be fun?</p>

<p><b>Multiple assets. One SmartKey.</b> Ethos SmartKeys allow you to safely access multiple digital assets without all the hassle. SmartKeys are hierarchically deterministic, which means they derive all your wallets from a single seed. Pretty cool!</p>

<p>Ethos Universal Wallet brings it all together, and then some. We’re starting with digital assets, but we’re building a hybrid ecosystem that brings together digital and traditional assets in powerful new ways. A complete view of your financial future.</p>

<p><b>SmartWallet</b> - Not just any wallet. Ethos Universal Wallet provides one of the best mobile-first, hot wallets to safely and securely interface with multiple assets on multiple blockchains. Truly a wallet to rule them all.</p>

<center><img src="/images/ethos-103.jpg" alt="what is ethos"></center>

<p><b>ColdWallet (coming soon)</b> - Offline for maximum security. Generate a SmartKey and watch your balance. Enter your mnemonic when you want to transact, but don’t expose it to the elements. Ice cold. Fully integrated.</p>

<p><b>WatchFolio</b> - It’s a portfolio tracker. Add info for digital assets you have stored somewhere else, add coins to your watchlist, or even create fantasy portfolios. your call. With WatchFolio, you can bring it all together in one place.</p>

<p><b>Coins</b> - Data-rich learning. Investing in the future can be a challenge. With Coins, you’ll have access to a powerful coin profiles that combine raw data, key facts, social intelligence – with technicals, market performance, ratings and more.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, bring unique benefits to the world of personal finance by pairing the ability to own and store your digital assets, with the ability to cheaply, securely and almost instantly transfer them to others.</p>

<p>A blockchain, simply put, is an open record keeping system that’s maintained by a peer-to-peer network where everyone has access to read and potentially write data. Because of the open nature of blockchain, it’s absolutely necessary that all the data on the chain is verifiable as authentic and can’t be manipulated after the fact. To guarantee that all of Their transactions are authentic, we turn to cryptography which gives us the ability to generate digital signatures and fingerprints.</p>

<p>The Ethos Smart Key is a unique digital signature that is used to verify the authenticity of transactions originating from your wallet. Any time a digital asset is transferred out of your Ethos Universal Wallet, your Smart Keys will provide the authorization needed to execute the transaction. Ethos Keys are “Smart” because your one key represents all of your funds, regardless of what form of cryptocurrency you are using. This allows you to backup and restore all of your wallets with a single key phrase.</p>

<h4>How safe is it?</h4>

<p>Ethos leverages well-tested cryptographic standards and methods to ensure that your Universal Wallet uses an extremely high degree of security. The passphrase is 24 words (vs the 12 word standard used in many wallets) and the keys themselves are 256 bit, meaning uncrackable.</p>

<p>As discussed in the next few sections, the bulk of the security offered by the Ethos Universal Wallet and Smart Keys comes from modern cryptographic techniques, such as public-key and elliptic-curve cryptography, and their ability to generate secure and verifiable digital signatures and fingerprints. Let’s first consider some background to fully understand the mathematical magnitude of the protection.</p>

<h4>Ciphers, Hashes, and Digital Fingerprints</h4>

<p>The concept of a cipher is fundamental to cryptography. The roots of cryptographic hashing go back to 50 BC, during the reign of Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. At that time, the official means of communication was a courier service that was highly vulnerable to espionage and interception. To throw off their enemies, the emperor and his consul would communicate by scrambling the letters of their messages before sending them. Upon receipt of a message, the letters would have to be unscrambled to reveal the original message.</p>

<center><img src="/images/ethos-104.jpg" alt="what is ethos"></center>

<p>One method of doing this was to shift every letter over by one, so that every instance of the letter ‘a’ would be replaced by ‘b’, ‘b’ would be replaced by ‘c’, and so on. This now commonly referred to as a Caesar Cipher, or a Shift Cipher, because the method to conceal the message is simply shifting each letter over one.</p>

<p>In this case the message ‘hello’ would become ‘ifmmp’ and the courier tasked with delivering it would ideally not be aware of the method used to scramble the message. Anyone who intercepted this message would also not know what to make of the seemingly nonsensical message. The “key” in this example is the method of encoding the message.</p>

<p>Over the next two thousand years, this idea of a cipher was further developed into that of a cryptographic hash, which in simple terms is a more sophisticated way of scrambling a message so that it’s very difficult to reverse. Hashes also have the property of, given some data, being able to reliably create a unique digital fingerprint of that data.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Everytime you submit a transaction to the blockchain, a fingerprint of your transaction is created and used to link the blocks in the blockchain, ensuring that the data in each block hasn’t been manipulated. For example, if you spend one bitcoin and someone tries to go back and manipulate the record to say you spent 10 bitcoin, it would invalidate all of the fingerprints in the blockchain leading back to that transaction.</p>

<h4>Digital Signatures - Public Key Cryptography</h4>

<p>Equally fundamental to the field of modern cryptography is the concept of Public Key Cryptography. In Public Key Cryptography there is the notion of a shared public-key that can be used by anyone to encrypt a message; then only you, with the corresponding private-key can decrypt to read the original message.</p>

<p>One of the most important properties of Public Key Cryptography is that, given a key-pair, its possible to generate a signature, digital proof of ownership of addresses that derive from your key. So whenever you send a transaction to the blockchain, it includes a signature proving that you are the owner of that address and therefore authorized to make that transaction. If the signature doesn’t match the public wallet address, the transaction is deemed to be unauthorized and is rejected by the network.</p>

<h4>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h4>

<p>Elliptic Curve Cryptography is a type of Public Key Cryptography that makes private and public key generation even more secure due to the mathematical properties of elliptic curves that make it extremely difficult to reverse engineer the private key from the public keys.</p>

<p>Ethos Smart Keys are created from a cryptographically random number known as a seed. Sometimes seeds are created by a random number generator. However, this isn’t 100 percent secure because sometimes a hacker can re-generate a random number by knowing when it was generated and using a timestamp.</p>

<p>To ensure a higher degree of randomness, you generate your seed with a combination of a random number and another random number created by shaking your phone the first time you open the app. The unique signal from this process ensures that no one will be able to guess a non-random seed like your birthday, phone number, or a timestamp.</p>

<p>This seed is then used to generate private and public key-pairs on a secp256k1 Elliptic Curve, the results of which are hashed several times and encoded to reveal your public wallet addresses. By creating your Smart Keys this way, you can safely share your public keys and rest assured that only you have access to spend the funds in those wallets with your <a href="/what-is-a-private-key/">private key</a>.</p>

<h2 id="howto">How To Get An Ethos Wallet?</h2>

<h4>Ethos Token</h4>

<p>The token ticker for Ethos is ETHOS. Some places you may see the token referred to by its previous ticker BQX. BQX and ETHOS are the same token and there is nothing you need to do if you own a token referenced by either ticker.</p>

<p>ETHOS is the “fuel” that powers the Ethos Ecosystem. Any developer can build applications that leverage Ethos wallets, keys or data in Bedrock and pay for micro-service API utilization through the ETHOS Token.</p>

<p>Additionally, ETHOS tokens reduce the cost for consumers, businesses and developers and enabling micropayments at very low cost to create a safe, secure and verified way for anybody to participate in the new economy.</p>

<p>ETHOS offers the consumers, businesses and developers several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced costs for consumers</li>
<li>Low-cost applications for developers</li>
<li>Scalable micropayment transfer mechanism for all platform services</li>
<li>Supports a open financial ecosystem that bridges traditional and crypto assets</li>
<li>Enables verified source of funds through the Ethos ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>ETHOS is available to US and Singapore participants through reputable Exchanges.  Ethos does not endorse or support any particular Exchange. Binance, Coinexchange, HitBTC, EtherDelta and Coinspot.   Please note that Ethos does not recommend or endorse any exchanges and assumes no responsibility with respect to those services.</p>

<p>If your tokens don’t appear automatically then do the following:</p>

<p>Look for “add token” in your wallet</p>

<p>You can enter the contract address: <code>0x5af2be193a6abca9c8817001f45744777db30756</code></p>

<p>The Token Ticker: ETHOS</p>

<p>And the decimal number: 8</p>

<p>And you should be able to see your tokens.</p>

<p>ETHOS is not a security, or Tokenized Security, because it does not meet the legal definition of a security applicable in the United States, Canada, Singapore, United Kingdom or any other OECD jurisdiction. In the United States, this is more commonly referred to the “Howey Test”</p>

<h4>Howey Test</h4>

<p>The “Howey Test” is a test created by the Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as “investment contracts.” If so, then under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, those transactions are considered securities and therefore subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements. A security is found to exist when all 4 of these elements exist, 1) investment of money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with an expectation of profits 4) from the efforts of others. Although Their Token Sale involved an investment of money, none of the three remaining elements were applicable.</p>
