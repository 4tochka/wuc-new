<p>Power Ledger is a distributed, <a href="/bitcoin-expert/">interoperable energy trading platform</a> that supports an extensive suite of energy-focused applications. It features a live and deployed platform that possesses the ability for others to develop applications for use on it. Power Ledger aims to solve 2 major problems using Blockchain technology:</p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-001.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p><b>1.</b> Declining utilization of electricity networks which could be maintained through a marketplace for distributed energy assets and associated transactions underpinned by the blockchain (e.g. peer to peer trading across networks)</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Low penetration of renewables in apartment buildings, where a shared ownership and allocation model for microgrids could be <a href="/bitcoin-changetip/">provided by the blockchain</a> (e.g. peer to peer trading in buildings)</p>

<p>In alignment with their vision, there are several applications that have been developed on the Power Ledger Platform that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>P2P trading of Electricity within the Ecosystem</li>
<li>Smart Demand & Supply Management for Retailers</li>
<li>Microgrid/Embedded Network Operator</li>
<li>Wholesale Market Settlement</li>
<li>Autonomous Asset Management</li>
<li>Electric Vehicle Management</li>
<li>Power Port</li>
<li>Carbon Trading</li>
<li>Transmission Exchange</li>
</ul>

<h4>Token System</h4>

<p>There’s a dual token system in place for Power Ledger, similar to that of Factom:</p>

<p><b>1. POWR Tokens:</b> Serves as the fuel of the Ecosystem. In order to participate in the platform, you need POWR to generate Sparkz</p>

<p><b>2. Sparkz Token:</b> Represents the value of a unit of energy and will be pegged to the domestic currency (i.e. Aussie Dollars). Sparkz is the currency that will be used for transactions within the Ecosystem</p>

<p>What’s interesting about Power Ledger’s dual token system is their applications within 2 concurrent models:</p>
{% include page-toc.html %}
<p>This dual model approach is a great idea in concurrently focusing towards 2 main markets; the retail market and the direct P2P. This model affords high degrees of platform (and application) adaptability not only towards existing market structures but also a deregulated market setting. </p>

<p>I feel that this exudes practicality in implementing their vision but also pragmatism in preparing for the future; similar to hitting two birds with one stone.</p>

<h4>Team</h4>

<p>The Board of Directors consists of experienced individuals in the field of renewable energy and Blockchain technologies, headed by Dr Jemma Green. She has considerable experience in investment banking and a research fellow at Curtin University Sustainability Policy (CUSP) Institute. </p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-002.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p>The Board also consists of John Bulich and Dr Gov Van Ek, who founded Ledger Assets, a Blockchain venture that has successfully created and commercialized technical and <a href="/bitcoin-charity/">commercial blockchain systems</a> and applications such as Uproov.</p>

<p>The Power Ledger team has a vibrant mix of energy specialists, legal expertise and consist mostly of developers and software engineers. It looks like a good line-up for what they’re building.</p>

<h4>Prominent Investors/Backers</h4>

<p>There are several high-profile investors that backs the project, which is a good indicator of its viability and prospects. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blockchain Capital:</b> The pioneer VC fund focused on the Blockchain space</li>
<li><b>Bill Tai:</b> Venture capitalist that was the Founding Chairman and CEO of iAsiaWorks, and is a board member of Bitfury. He is also an advisor to the project</li>
<li><b>Mike Novogratz:</b> Billionaire investor and ex-hedge fund manager</li>
</ul>
<h4>Track Record</h4>

<p>Unlike most ICOs, Power Ledger already has “proofs of concept” in the form of successful pilot projects in Australia and New Zealand. With the support of some established energy retailers, they’ve deployed their first commercial project in 2017, becoming the first Australian company to “facilitate electricity trading across the meter and manage settlements without going through an electricity retailer.”. Here is a list of their traction:</p>

<h4>Power Ledger Applications</h4>

<p><b>P2P TRADING</b> - This class of Platform Application gives retailers the ability to empower consumers (or in an unregulated environment, the consumers themselves) to simply trade electricity with one another and receive payment in real-time from an automated and trustless reconciliation and settlement system. </p>

<p>There are many other immediate benefits such as being able to select a clean energy source, trade with neighbors, receive more money for excess power, benefit from transparency of all your trades on a blockchain and very low-cost settlement costs all leading to lower power bills and improved returns for investments in distributed renewables.</p>

<p><b>NEO-RETAILER</b> - This class of Platform Application provides Neo-retailers’ with smart demand and supply management, along with almost instantaneous remuneration and payment settlements while managing consumer exposure to the risk of non-supply.</p>
{% include page-toc.html %}
<p><b>MICROGRID/EMBEDDED NETWORK OPERATOR/STRATA</b> - This type of Platform Application enables electricity metering, big data acquisition, rapid micro transactions and grid management at an unprecedented granular scale. Trading in embedded networks breaks the nexus between generation ownership and energy consumption meaning value can be derived from an investment in DER even if the investor is absent or doesn’t consume all the energy they generate.</p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-004.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p><b>WHOLESALE MARKET SETTLEMENT</b> - This Platform Application class offers rapid low-cost and transparent dispatch optimization and management, data aggregation, reconciliation and settlement for wholesale energy marketplaces.</p>

<p><b>AUTONOMOUS ASSET (AA) MANAGEMENT</b> - This current Platform Application allows for (1) shared ownership of renewable energy assets and (2) trading renewable asset ownership. The AA is able to buy and sell its own electricity and distribute its income to assigned wallet addresses.</p>

<p><b>DISTRIBUTED MARKET MANAGEMENT</b> - This Platform Application provides optimized metering data, the collection of big data, right to access and dispatch of assets, <a href="/bitcoin-legal-issues/">rapid transaction settlement</a>, network load balancing, frequency management, demand side response and demand side and load management. The optimization of network assets is made viable by the near real-time remuneration of asset owners.</p>

<p><b>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</b> - This class of Platform Application facilitates real time metering data (interfacing with the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)), collection of data, user identification and rapid transaction settlement.</p>

<p><b>POWER PORT</b> - A class of Platform Application whereby virtual pipeline and roadside assistance type assets may be automated via the platform, such as EVs, and can provide a mobile storage discharge facility maintaining energy supplies to predominantly self-sufficient energy consumers.</p>

<p><b>CARBON TRADING</b> - This Platform Application class offers smart contracts for carbon traders to assure digital transactions across organizations; credibility of asset using immutable distributed ledger technology; and transparency and auditability. It supports reporting and surrendering of carbon credits or certificates to regulatory authorities.</p>

<p><b>TRANSMISSION EXCHANGE</b> - In the management of transmission networks, the Platform can provide real time metering data, collection of big data, right to access and dispatch assets, rapid transaction settlement, network load balancing, responding to non-stationary energy.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With Power Ledger</h2>

<center><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7U0YojaoigI" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>The Power Ledger system tracks the generation and consumption of all trading participants and settles energy trades on pre-determined terms and conditions in near real time. </p>

<p>A user simply receives a registration email from their Application Host, they click on a link which takes them to the Power Ledger platform where they create a userid and password. That’s it, once logged in they can see their electricity usage and all their P2P trading transaction details.</p>

<p>As Power Ledger is a commercially operating entity, we already have platform applications built, which is explained in figure 5.3.1 in the white paper. The roadmap outlines the priority we plan to develop the applications in, with the aim for all to be deployed in two years. </p>

<p>There will be no incubation time as we have multiple applications already built and operational. Therefore, customer engagement will be high from day one, as it is now.</p>

<p>They are hoping that the sale will raise enough to support development for a global Power Ledger platform, to spread the tokens far and wide and allow as many potential future users to have access to the tokens from inception. Power Ledger is a movement, They want to give power back to the people and tokens will catalyze this movement. </p>

<p>There is always the possibility of releasing additional tokens from the Power Ledger reserve if They require future funding, which should provide token buyers comfort knowing the platform is sustainable and that it’s not just a once off all or nothing outcome to success.</p>

<p>Their platform design leverages our experience and understanding of how the energy system is evolving and provides the greatest opportunity for energy system disruption without the destruction of incumbent value that is often the result of technology change and adoption. </p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-005.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p>Power Ledger is one of the early pioneers in this space. We officially launched in May 2016, after months of planning, and our management team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. Our platform is already developed and usable applications are already running on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Power Ledger has developed a series of world-leading blockchain energy applications, such as our P2P energy trading application that allows businesses, such as Utilities, to host trading on the Platform. </p>

<p>Blockchain technology provides a transparent, auditable and automated market trading and clearing mechanism for the benefit of producers and consumers. Our technology enables the sale of surplus renewable energy generated at residential and commercial developments (including multi-unit/multi-tenanted) connected to existing electricity distribution networks, or within micro-grids. </p>

<p>Power Ledger puts the power to manage the energy economy into the hands of consumers, while maintaining the value of existing distribution networks.</p>

<p>Power Ledger allows for each unit of electricity to be tracked from the point of generation to the point of consumption within the building it is generated, or when sold to other consumers, using the local <a href="/onecoin-another-cryptocurrency/">electricity distribution network</a>. </p>

<p>Blockchain technology couples a tracked energy transaction with a financial one, making the process of realising the value of renewable energy investments simple and secure. </p>

<p>Power Ledger allows renewable energy asset owners to decide who they want to sell their surplus energy to and at what price. Energy traded across the distribution network is tracked providing a secure revenue stream for DNSPs.</p>

<p>Power Ledger is the brainchild of a team of respected energy industry professionals, sustainability leaders, disruptors, developers and innovators. It is a team with technical expertise, commercial acumen, regulatory knowledge and a relentless passion to revolutionise the energy sector for the benefit of consumers, producers and distributors.</p>

<h2 id="howto">How To Get A Power Ledger Wallet?</h2>

<p>Power Ledger’s token, POWR will be created as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and will be integrated into Power Ledger as the primary interface token.</p> 

<p>It is fundamentally a protocol token that will not only provide access to the Ethereumpowered platform for users to purchase electricity with it (or through their local utility) but also act as a reward or incentive to electricity producers and consumers who settle their production and consumption through the Power Ledger platform.</p>

<p>There are 350 million tokens available in the Token Generation Event. The market will price the tokens. Depends on amount raised. .."All 350,000,000 tokens will be issued following the close of the Token Sale regardless of the amount raised". We are allowing the market to determine the price.</p>

<p>There is no Minimum or Maximum $ raise. All tokens will be issued irrespective of the $ value raised. This allows everyone to receive an allocation, without the problems of previous token sales that were sold out in minutes. </p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-006.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p>Additionally, larger buyers known as ‘whales’ will be discouraged as there is no advantage to jumping the queue with large transaction fees and massive orders as the pricing and allocation they receive will be the same as all other token buyers. </p>

<p>Based on previous token sales we have studied we believe this allows for the most equitable distribution and pricing. The rationale is to allow everyone who wants tokens to get them. To allow the actual platform participants (users) to benefit from the growth and success of Power Ledger. </p>

<p>Additionally POWR tokens incentivize its owners to use and support the platform which creates a networking effect. All tokens will be distributed regardless of minimum raise, as Power Ledger is already equity funded and will continue its development regardless of funds raised in the TGE.</p>
{% include page-toc.html %}
<p>There is no cap on the amount of contributions that will be accepted by the Power Ledger Board. The Power Ledger Board have chosen to go with an uncapped ICO so that all investors will have an opportunity to participate. The fundraiser will have a fixed period of 4 weeks in which POWR tokens will be available for purchase.</p>

<p>Following the example set by the Ethereum Foundation and many other high profile and successful token sales, there is no cap on the amount of contributions that will be accepted by the Power Ledger Board. </p>

<p>The Board believes that an un-capped fundraiser will promote a widespread distribution of the tokens, a necessary prerequisite to launching a robust network. Though the amount of POWR is denominated in ETH, contributions may also be made in Bitcoin that will be converted at the prevailing rate on a best effort basis.</p>

<p>BTC, ETH, LTC. Your POWR allocation will be calculated using the USD price of the payment coin (ETH, BTC, LTC) you used at the time it is received by Power Ledger. The Tokens will be allocated according to the USD market value of the payment coin received (ETH, BTC or LTC) calculated at the time their payment was received by Power Ledger.</p>

<p>The POWR tokens will be distributed to the buyer’s Ethereum public address supplied. The POWR tokens acquired will be issued at any time after the close of the TGE, but no later than 4 weeks after the Token Sale closes.</p>

<p>Token holders will have access to the Power Ledger platform. They can potentially use POWR tokens to purchase electricity when the Power Ledger platform becomes available in their area. <a href="/video-pivx-2017-roadmap/">Token holders</a> can also participate in Asset Germination events by submitting POWR tokens. </p>

<p>By keeping hold of POWR tokens you won’t have to buy them on an exchange later if you decide to use the platform. As we on-board more participants there will be a requirement for more POWR tokens either in circulation throughout the eco-system or escrowed in a SmartBond.</p>

<p>35% - POWR tokens available to investors during the TGE </p>

<p>25% - Growth Pool - will be used to incentivize users and encourage Application Hosts to come onto the platform - this is a big plus to existing holders of POWR tokens as they are also escrowed for up to 3 years after distribution (in addition to being used as security in the Smart Bond.)</p>

<p>15% - Developers Pool is escrowed. </p>

<p>25% - Power Ledger’s Reserve - Will be escrowed and only used to fund further development and operating costs if required. This de-risks the company. If Platforms distribute too much of their tokens too early and further down the road they run out of funds, the risks to the company and <a href="/video-decentralizing-the-internet-maidsafe/">early token buyers</a> can be significant. It’s prudent for management to hold a % tokens in reserve and is the model that is increasingly being adopted by other well received token sales.</p>

<center><img src="/images/power-ledger-007.jpg" alt="power ledger coin"></center>

<p>You must have access to your private key. Check with your wallet or exchange. Do not supply an ETH address from wallet and exchange providers like Coinbase or from multisig wallets. Please use a wallet that supports ERC20 Ethereum tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, Mist, or imToken. Throughout the TGE we never deal with a user’s private keys.</p>

<p>The sale hasn't happened yet, so they will be tradable on a recognized exchange or ERC20 token exchanger after the sale and at some point in the future after that. Please join our Telegram group for updates.</p>
