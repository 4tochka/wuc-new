<h2 id="what">What Is QASH?</h2>

<p>QASH is a <a href="/the-price-of-counterparty-token-multiplies-by-2/">crypto token</a> that is designed to be used for all services provided by the LIQUID PLATFORM and QUOINE’s existing exchange platforms as explained in this content. QASH also can be used as a Crypto Token to pay for any other services provided by other business entities. QUOINE will generally not limit the usage of QASH or the types of business entities that would like to use QASH for their business.</p>

<p>QASH is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction. This white paper is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Please note that purchases of QASH are final and non-refundable.</p>

<p>Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring QASH.</p>

<h4>LIMITATION OF THE PURCHASERS</h4>

<p>You are not eligible to and you shall not purchase QASH through its token sale if you are a citizen or resident (tax or otherwise) of any country or state where the purchase of QASH or similar Crypto Token may be prohibited or the token sale is deemed to be not compliant with the applicable laws and regulations. In particular, if you are a resident of People’s Republic of China, you cannot purchase QASH through the token sale.</p>

<p>Purchases of QASH should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of Crypto Tokens and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other Crypto Tokens. Any entities of QUOINE and officers and employees thereof will not be responsible in any way for loss of any Crypto Tokens, QASH or fiat currency resulting from actions taken by, or omissions of the purchasers. If you do not have the required experience or expertise, then you should not purchase QASH or participate in the sale of QASH.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>You should carefully consider the risks, costs, and any other demerits of acquiring QASH, and, if necessary, obtain your own independent advice in this regard. If you are not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated with the token sale of QASH (including the risks related to the non-development of LIQUID PLATFORM) or any other risks as indicated in this content, you should not acquire QASH, until such that you have received the necessary independent advice.</p>

<h4>RISKS</h4>

<p>The purchase of QASH carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing QASH, the purchaser should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional prior to determining whether to purchase QASH.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> QASH will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the purchaser. If a purchaser of QASH does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of QASH. If your password protection is weak and it is cracked or learned by somebody else, this may also lead to the loss of QASH. As a result, purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The purchaser recognizes that some of the services under the LIQUID PLATFORM is currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The purchaser acknowledges that any of its expectations regarding the form and functionality of the LIQUID PLATFORM may not be met for any number of reasons.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> The purchaser understands that while QUOINE will make best efforts to connect the LIQUID PLATFORM to most of the major Crypto exchanges around, it is possible that some exchanges may decline the connection with the LIQUID PLATFORM, which may result in the less liquidity provided through the LIQUID PLATFORM than expected in this content.</p>

<p><b>(d)</b> The purchaser understands that while QUOINE will make best efforts to release the LIQUID PLATFORM on time, it is possible that the official release may be delayed.</p>

<p><b>(e)</b> As with other Crypto Tokens, value of QASH may fluctuate significantly and become reduced in value for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall Crypto Tokens’ market conditions, political or geographical reasons, changes of regulations in any jurisdictions, and technical reasons.</p>

<p><b>(f)</b> QASH will be issued on the <a href="/video-ethereum-private-blockchain/">Ethereum blockchain</a>. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the <a href="/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> protocol may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold QASH. Such impact could adversely affect the value of QASH.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, QASH, any entities of QUOINE and officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data), arising out of or in connection with any acceptance of or reliance on this content or any part thereof by you.</p>

<p>Any entities of QUOINE and officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for your loss of QASH after it is transferred to you by any reason including but not limited to your failure to maintain or backup an accurate record of your password or password cracking by somebody due to your poor maintenance of your password.</p>

<p>QUOINE will do its best to launch its operations and develop LIQUID PLATFORM. Any person undertaking to acquire QASH acknowledges and understands however that QUOINE does not provide with any warranty as to the release of the LIQUID PLATFORM. They acknowledge and understand therefore that QUOINE (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use the QASH.</p>

In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact QUOINE’s business and may limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to acquire QASH must be aware that QUOINE’s business model or LIQUID PLATFORM and its existing platforms may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such case, purchasers and any person undertaking to acquire QASH acknowledge and understand that neither QUOINE nor any of its affiliate shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damages caused by such changes.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With QASH</h2>

<p>Each day, more and more token issuers are experiencing cyber-attacks, hacks, and impersonators which have led to multimillion dollars’ worth of theft. This is because current ICO platforms do not have the proper security measures in place for purchasers to deposit and transfer their funds.</p>

<p>Deposits are typically transferred from one ETH address to another without proper KYC checks, often using a single publicly announced address for purchasers to send their funds. Hackers and scammers take advantage of this by posting fake ETH addresses on forums, and unsuspecting token purchasers end up transferring crypto to the hackers' addresses.</p>

<p>To ensure this does not happen with QASH Token Sale, we have placed stringent, preventative measures to ensure a safe, secure, and compliant process for all token participants by carrying out our Token Sale only through our secure ICO and trading platform, QRYPTOS.</p>

<p>LIQUIDITY, the lifeblood of every industry, is the single most important element lacking in the crypto economy today.</p>

<p>The only available resources of liquidity are siloed across:</p>

<p>Developed markets that have standalone exchanges operating in closed pools of liquidity, which are not available to non-residents.</p>

<p>Emerging markets which are underserved with illiquid local currencies that must interact with bigger liquidity pools to utilize crypto tokens in their home currencies.</p>

<center><img src="/images/qash-101.jpg" alt="what is qash"></center>

<h4>Solution: LIQUID Platform</h4>

<p>QUOINE is launching a single globally-sourced trading platform (World Book) with an associated suite of services (Prime Brokerage) that brings together the entire global network of cryptocurrency exchanges to enable the highest level of liquidity to all markets.</p>

<center><img src="/images/qash-102.jpg" alt="what is qash"></center>

<p>QUOINE's LIQUID platform is a financial utility that will benefit the entire crypto economy. A platform where token issuers, token holders, innovators, and users of next generation financial services all benefit and contribute to Liquidity.</p>

<center><img src="/images/qash-103.jpg" alt="what is qash"></center>

<p>We envision QASH to be the preferred payment token for financial services, like the Bitcoin for financial services.</p>

<p>As more financial institutions, fintech startups and partners adopt QASH as a method of payment, the utility of QASH will scale, fueling the Fintech revolution.</p>

<h2 id="howto">How To Get A QASH Wallet?</h2>

<h4>Add QASH to Your Ledger Nano</h4>

<p>So you heard about cryptocurrencies from a friend, and you bought QUOINE’s QASH token. They’re sitting on an exchange and you want to deposit the QASH into your hardware wallet. Here’s how you do it!</p>

<p>First get some QASH from an exchange. I use QRYPTOS, and my account looks like the screenshot below. On QRYPTOS, you’ll need to get your account approved before you’re able to withdraw any currency. For reference, I waited 3 business days for my account verification, and I’m based in the US.</p>

<center><img src="/images/qash-106.jpg" alt="what is qash"></center>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the account screen. Clicking on each cryptocurrency on the left panel shows your deposit and withdrawal options for that particular cryptocurrency. If you click on QASH, you’ll see an“Add Crypto Address” link in the Withdraw panel. Before adding an address, you’ll need to create a QASH-compatible wallet to deposit your coins into. Since QASH is an ERC-20 token, it works with the Ledger Nano Ethereum wallet. You simply need to create a custom token in your <a href="/how-to-use-ledger-wallet-nano-with-coinkite/">Ledger Ethereum wallet</a> first. Let’s go create one!</p>

<h4>LIQUID QASH analysis in detail ($QASH)</h4>

<p>The Liquid Qash project - ran by Quoine Pte. Ltd. - wants to connect as many crypto exchanges as possible to create a liquidity pool. Users from one exchange will be able to trade with users from any of the other connected exchanges. For instance if gdax and bitfinex are connected to Liquid Qash, a gdax user selling 500 ETH can have its order matched with a bitfinex user buying ETH - the most amazing thing is that this match can be done even if the buyer and seller trade on different currency pairs (Liquid Qash's world book will do the currency exchange and it will be transparent to the user). Effectively, Liquid Qash's world book will unite order books from various crypto exchanges and will be "currency-agnostic".</p>
