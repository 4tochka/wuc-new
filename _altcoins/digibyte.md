<h4>Getting Your First DigiBytes</h4>

<center><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOV-Ir1Q4T4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p><b>Step 1 Download A DigiByte Wallet</b> - Navigate to the download section of this website and choose the wallet that you would like to start with.  The "core" desktop wallets are considered to be the most stable and most secure as they are what is called "full nodes."</p>

<p><b>Step 2 Option Buy DigiBytes On An Exchange</b> - The easiest way to acquire your first DigiBytes is to purchase them on an exchange.  Two exchanges most people start with are Poloniex.com or Bittrex.com </p>

<p>Typically you will need to use your fiat currency to purchase Bitcoin first and then trade Bitcoin for DigiBytes on the above-mentioned exchanges.</p>

<p><b>Step 2 Option Accept DigiByte As Payment</b> - You can begin accepting DigiBytes as payment for any kind of goods or services you sell.  All you need to do is download a wallet and send a person paying you a DigiByte address.</p>

<p><b>Step 2 Option Earn DigiBytes By Mining</b> - You can begin earning DigiBytes by contributing your computing power to a process that is known as mining.  Mining is how new DigiBytes enter circulation.</p>

<h2 id="howto">How To Get A DigiByte Wallet?</h2>

<p>The DigiByte Core Wallet is the <a href="/bitcoin-ledger-wallet-review/">primary wallet</a> used for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.</p>

<p>Anybody can run the DigiByte Core Wallet, and get started with sending / receiving DigiByte in seconds!</p>

<p>This guide will take you through installing the wallet and finding your DigiByte address so you can begin receiving DigiByte.</p>

<p><b>Step 1)</b></p>

<p>Head over to the DigiByte Website and download the wallet</p>
<p>– Visit www.digibyte.co and click on “Choose Wallet”</p>
<p>– Select the wallet for your operating system. If you’re a Windows user and unsure, start with “Windows 32-Bit”.</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-101.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p><b>Step 2)</b></p>

<p>Install the Wallet</p>
<p>– Follow through the installation, accepting the defaults is perfectly fine</p>

<p><b>Step 3)</b></p>
<p>Open up DigiByte Core Wallet</p>
<p>– It will tell you it’s going to take a while to sync, this is OK to hide.</p>
<p>– If it tells you it’s going to take 10 years, there is an issue in DigiByte Core Wallet 6.14.2. Try leaving the DigiByte Core Wallet open on your PC overnight and it should complete the blockchain download (Approx 4GB)</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-102.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p><b>Step 4)</b></p>

<p>Locate your DigiByte receiving address</p>
<p>– This is also known as your “Public Key” or “Public Address”. This is what you will give out to people to receive DigiByte.</p>
<p>– Click on File –> Receiving Addresses</p>
<p>– Right-click where it says “(no label)” and choose “Edit”. Give your wallet a label, such as “Main wallet address” and click “OK”.</p>
<p>– Click on your “Main wallet address” and choose “Copy” from the bottom.</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-103.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p>Congratulations! You’re now ready to take your DigiByte Wallet Address and give it to somebody to receive your first DigiByte. However, before we go any further we’re going to make a backup.</p>

<p><b>Step 5)</b></p>

<p>Backup your Wallet somewhere safe</p>
<p>– Go to File –> Backup Wallet</p>
<p>– Save it to your Desktop</p>
<p>– Now you’ll want to email this to yourself, store it on your dropbox, save it to a USB drive and take it somewhere else safe. If you lose this “Wallet.dat” file, your DigiByte will never, ever be able to be retrieved.</p>
<p>– Presume that your PC will one day be lost, stolen, or crash, you need this somewhere remotely saved so that you can recover it later on down the track.</p>

<h2 id="buy">How To Buy DigiByte?</h2>

<p>DigiByte (DGB) is a rapidly growing global blockchain with a focus on cybersecurity for digital payments & decentralized applications. Over 4 years, DigiByte has become the world's fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain today.</p>

<p>HitBTC is one of the most popular crypto currency exchanges, judging by the Bitcoin trading volume. Other than that they offer a wide variety of allcoins, much like Bittrex.</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-104.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p>While being a well-established exchange, HitBTC does not officially provide information on the country in which they are based. Some reports link them to Europe, while others suggest Hong Kong. We aren’t certain at this point, but what we are sure is that they are no regulated.</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-105.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p>The majority of the companies in the crypto-space are not regulated, which always brings a bit of worry, when dealing with them. Most regulatory agencies, like the UK’s FCA, do not recognize such entities as which they should monitor (yet). HitBTC is also not registered as a <a href="/what-is-bitcoin">payment provider</a>, as it only provides banking services to “institutional investors and major market makers”.</p>

<p>HitBTC was hacked in early 2016, but didn’t provide much information on the incident. While users haven’t complained at that particular event, a lot of negative feedback is available in the forums. The reported issues are of all types, from a slow verification procedure, to coins “lost”, to not allowing withdrawals, to … basically every problem one can imagine. On top of that, there are claims the BTC volume at this exchange is artificially increased.</p>

<center><img src="/images/digibyte-106.jpg" alt="digibyte"></center>

<p><b>Trading conditions</b></p>

<p>There are over 150 digital assets available at HitBTC. Most of them are traded against Bitcoin and Ethereum. When it comes to the (fiat) currencies, some coins are traded versus the UDST (USD Tether, a cryptocurrency, backed by real dollars) and even fewer against EUR.</p>

<p><b>Minimum initial deposit</b></p>

<p>The minimum deposit at HitBTC is everything above the given coin’s network fee. This is quite obvious to experienced traders, but may not be for newbies. Given the fact the company does not accept fiat currency deposits from most clients, mentioning a USD level will not make much sense.</p>

<p><b>Leverage</b></p>

<p>Trading on leverage is not allowed at HitBTC. While some traders would enjoy such a service, this is not necessarily a “must”, as cryptocurrencies tend to be very volatile. In comparison, the “traditional” currencies fluctuate by very small amounts, and great leverage ratios are required in order to achieve meaningful day trading results. Some forex brokers even go a bit out of hand, providing 1:500 in leverage.</p>

<p><b>Fees</b></p>

<p>HitBTC charges 0.10% in trading fees from those who buy/sell from the first available bid/ask, the so called market “takers”. On the other hand traders who provide liquidity (by placing their own bids and asks) are paid a 0.01% rebate. These are very competitive commissions, given the fact some companies charge fees from market makers, instead of giving them rebates. Nowadays the taker fee goes as high as 0.25% for the traders operating with low volumes.</p>

<p>If you only want to speculate on the future value of Bitcoin and not bother with owning the actual coins, you can alternatively try one of the forex brokers, which provides bitcoin trading. The fees there are included in the spread, which makes them a bit harder to compare, to the ones provided by exchanges. You can read our full side-by-side comparison of the two services here.</p>

<p><b>Trading platform</b></p>

<p>HitBTC offers a web-based platform, something which is common among crypto-exchanges. While this has the obvious drawback of increasing your browser’s resource consumption (mostly RAM nowadays), it does still allow you to access your account from any device. This is not the case with leading forex trading platforms, like MetaTrader4 (MT4). That being said, the layout available at HitBTC is fairly nice. </p>

<p>Here is a preview Charting is provided by TradingView and a pop-up feature is provided for more detailed analysis. The instrument list is placed next to it and more importantly it is devided into four categories. The order book also looks neat, placed at in the bottom of the page. One of the most unique features of HitBTC is the “chatbox”, appropriately called the “Trollbox”. Despite the content not being very sophisticated, the functionality may come in handy, when a major news story breaks-out, as at least some traders will share what they have found.</p>

<center><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb_cKZIEc00" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p><b>Methods of payment</b></p>

<p>HitBTC only accepts bank transfers from institutional level clients. The regular traders/investors must transfer their crypto-assets directly. Wallets are provided for every major coin, available at HitBTC, which means basically every major coin.</p>

<p>HitBTC is a popular cryptocurrency exchange. It provides trading in over 150 different coins, with new ones being added constantly.</p>

<h2 id="mining">What Is DigiByte Mining?</h2>

<p>DigiByte mining is the process in which new DigiBytes enter circulation on the global network.  This process is carried out through a process known as proof of work. POW is considered the most secure method of ensuring trust and security on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Mining is conducted by donating your computing power to process aka mine "blocks" of transactions on the network.  You will need either a CPU, GPU, or ASIC hardware attached to your computer to mine DigiByte. You will also need specialized mining software and a DigiByte wallet.</p>

<p>You have two options when it comes to mining; you can choose to solo mine or mine on your own from your own computer or you can join something known as a mining "pool."  Mining pools are by far the most popular method used today.</p>

<p>A mining pool is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network, to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to solving a block.</p>

<p>Since mining is often attributed to something like the lottery, solo mining often does not give you a high chance of solving a block,  especially with low hash rates.</p>

<p>With DigiByte you have the ability to choose to mine on five separate algorithms.  These algorithms include; sha256, skein, qubit, groestl and scrypt.  Each algorithm is better suited to different types of mining hardware. Sha256 & scrypt are now almost exclusively mined by advanced "ASIC" miners. Skein and groestl are good for GPU's and qubit is a combination of multiple types of hardware.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Specialized mining hardware can be quite costly and often times it is simply better just to purchase DigiBytes if you do not already own right computing hardware such as a gaming graphics card.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your mining hardware and mining algorithm you will need to configure your miner.  depending on your operating system, hardware and other factors there are literally tens of thousands of possible configurations for your miner. </p>

<p>You will also need to download a special mining software for the algorithm, hardware and operating system you are using.  There are several open source options to choose from when selecting mining software.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to spend several days before you have fully optimized your miner and mining software.  Google is your friend to help make this process as easy as possible.</p>

<p>Once you have configured everything the next step is to choose a mining pool so you have the best chance of earning DigiBytes. DigiHash is a great mining pool to start with because it is supported by the DigiByte foundation and part of the reward goes back to maintaining the network.</p>

<p>Start with CPU mining to learn the process.</p>

<p>Mining can be difficult to get started.</p>

<p>Specialized mining hardware can be very expensive.</p>

<p>There are tens of thousands of possible mining configurations.</p>

<p>Mining can be a fun endeavor to learn about blockchain technology.</p>

<h4>DigiByte decentralized digital currency that can rebound in price.</h4>

<p>Digital currencies are created with different purposes, developers interpret and focus on a need in order to solve a problem, used on the internet is a means of exchange, with properties very different from fiat money, it also allows instant transactions and transfers of property without borders, with cryptocurrencies you can buy physical goods and services, although they can also be restricted to a particular community, such as a social network or to be used in online games.</p>

<p>In this sense, digital currencies such as bitcoin are known as decentralized digital currencies, which mentions that there is no central point that controls the supply of money. Another reason for the creation of cryptocurrencies is based on the possibility of offering a technology that can track the traceability of each transaction, that is to say that with the blockchain it is possible to comply with the creation of a Decentralized Ledger, open to any audit, by any person at a global level, there are no secrets, everything is registered, for posterity.</p>
