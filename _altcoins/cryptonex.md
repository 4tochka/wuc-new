<p>Cryptonex platform (hereinafter "Cryptonex") is developed as international acquiring and it is based on the blockсhain technology. Instead of traditional methods, such as venture investments and share issue, financial model of cryptofinancing ICO – Initial Coin Offering - is used for capital rising. </p>

<p>We are convinced that the <a href="/blockchain-use-to-allow-faster-overseas-remittance/">blockchain technology</a> can speed up development of economic coparticipation, which is currently solving the sphere's problems by attracting a significant number of previously unclaimed people. The safe system based on blockchain technology is protected against unauthorized access. Users can convert fiat money to any cryptocurrencies and tokens, as well as spend cryptocurrency with the help of bank cards and mobile applications with contactless payments. </p>

<p>Cryptonex is developed as an open source code platform. To account property rights, cryptocurrency of the same name Cryptonex, ticker CNX is used. Cryptocurrency Cryptonex will be in free trade on centralized exchanges in October–November 2017, as soon as the backoffice and the web wallet are launched.</p>

<p>Blockchain is a fundamentally new kind of database technology realization. It is optimized to solve a certain set of shortcomings of other similar technologies. Traditionally, databases have been created as centralized repositories for data processing and transactions conducting. Limited technical capabilities and security issues are the reason of distributed databases rare functioning. </p>

<p>Blockchain is a technology for distributed databases realization, allowing to carry out transparent and safe transactions between participants of the system. By itself, blockchain is a database, founded on collating of distributed copies of the same database and divided into blocks of transactions between two or more parties. Each block contains transaction details, but the participants remain anonymous. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>The blocks are checked and verified by the entire network with the help of encryption mechanism, which compares unique signatures of the parties and the general information about a transaction. The transaction is considered confirmed if the result is the same for all the nodes. Addition to the chain of previous transactions occurs only after the confirmation. Otherwise,"consensus" will correct the result on the node with the false data. A register of blockchain is duplicated simultaneously in many places and each copy is updated separately in accordance with the data on new transactions.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>Encryption is used in blockchain to <a href="/confidential-transactions/">confirm transactions</a> by verifying the signatures of the parties, participating in a transaction. This guarantees the absence of «false» operations, which are not agreed by the parties involved. Complex mathematical calculations ("hashing") are performed with each attempt to enter information into the blockchain. They deal with the details of a current transaction, the data about the participants and the results of previous operations.</p>

<p>Dependence of a blockchain current state on the previous transactions ensures impossibility of their replacement by hackers. In case of hash sum mismatch and discrepancy with the results of all the rest nodes, the changed data is discarded.</p>

<h4>Transparency</h4>

<p>Blockchain is a distributed database, maintained and synchronized by interaction of multiple nodes (for example, by several partners, participating in frequent operations with each other). Transaction is added to the blockchain only if transaction data have been confirmed by all the parties. This means, that all the participants can access to one and the same information. It significantly increases the level of openness and transparency in comparison with the traditional systems. Their work often relies on various "hidden" databases, located behind firewalls, which are not available outside of a particular organization.</p>

<h4>Efficiency</h4>

<p>Support and maintenance of numerous copies of blockchain database is not less expensive than service of one centralized database. Practice confirms, that the parties, performing transactions, duplicate databases with one and the same information of an operation. Often this information differs and leads to costly, time-consuming negotiations between the organizations. Blockchain cancels the necessity of manually checks, which allows saving time and funds. </p>

<h4>Market Analysis</h4>

<p>Currently, the cryptocurrency market is constantly expanding, increasing capitalization and offering new channels of investments for its participants. In this analysis, we highlight the key moments of the cryptocurrency industry development to form understanding of ongoing processes, causes and effective relationships. </p>

<p>Since 2013, the price of Bitcoin has increased 90–100 times up to $1100 per unit. The industry experts consider the Cyprus banking crisis to be one of the main reasons for the cryptocurrency value growth, however, after a rapid rise, there was a predictable fall in the rate. The start of cryptopayments receiving in the local market caused an increase of Chinese players’ interest. </p>

<p>The rising attractiveness of the cryptocurrency as an object of alternative investments stopped the fall in the rate and led to Bitcoin strengthening. The Bitcoin price was more expensive in China than in other countries. As a result, there appeared plenty of speculative schemes and "black" methods of trading. The government did not like such kind of activity, and by the end of the year the <a href="/video-qa-why-has-mining-centralised-in-china/">Central Bank of China</a> had forbidden cryptocurrency operations and recommended the investors not to invest their funds. <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> instantly reacted by a two-fold collapse in value. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy, that by the end of 2013, 1,000 the market participants had owned half of all the assets. This also facilitated destabilizing of the situation at the <a href="/bitcoin-learn-foreign-exchange-market/">cryptocurrency market</a>. Such fluctuations attracted mass media attention. As a result, there was an impetus to the development, mining popularization and new cryptocurrencies creation. use the currency in economics; however, the overall level of trust was extremely low.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons was security issue. It is worth remembering the example of Japanese exchange Mt.Gox, that lost $473 million because of the hacker attack. In 2015, despite the sharp ups and downs of the previous year, Bitcoin strengthened to $450, and in 2016 its value reached $900 per unit. It was facilitated by the increase of payments in Bitcoins around the world, devaluation of the Yuan, and growing demand of the Chinese investors, who found the way to bypass the currency control of the government. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Not the last influence was rendered by the fact that despite difficulties in interaction efficiency Chinese exchanges did not collect commission for transactions. This formed a convenient environment for high-frequency trading and rising of exchange trade turnover on the cryptocurrency market. However, the Central Bank of China warned the investors again, and later announced the audit of a number of exchanges for providing financial stability of processes. </p>

<p>The exchanges temporary restricted funds withdrawal, introduced commission for conversion and suspended the margin trade, resulting in the Bitcoin rate fall from $1,100 to $800. The Bitcoin capitalization increase and growing interest of the world community led to new cryptocurrencies creation. The top five places were occupied by such altcoins as <a href="/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin</a>, <a href="/what-is-ripple/">Ripple (XRP)</a>, <a href="/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="/what-is-dash/">Dash</a>. The number of fraudulent SCAM-projects increased. </p>

<p>Growth of Ethereum became acceptable among the main altkoins. Its price was growing significantly during 2016 due to development of decentralized applications, organizing and carrying out the first ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Despite the hacker attack and the subsequent division into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum classic (ETC), by the end of the year the ETH growth had almost been 300%. It is interesting, that ETC showed its viability: its price has doubled according to the results of the year.</p>
