<p>Bytom (The Bytom Blockchain Protocol) will not be another Bitcoin, nor will it be Ethereum 2.0. Bytom is an intermediary connecting <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/blockchain-use-to-allow-faster-overseas-remittance/">generalized blockchains with specialized blockchains</a>. In the past, there has not been a complete and effective blockchain protocol for the purpose of exchanging diversified digital assets. Bytom is designed to be the public blockchain specifically for the area of asset management in an attempt to solve the following problems:</p>

<center><img src="/images/bytom-102.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<ul>
<li>What kind of blockchain is needed to carry digital assets.</li>
<li>How to establish the mapping relationship between physical and digital assets , and resolve compliance issues.</li>
<li>How to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds to promote effective flow of assets on-chain and off-chain.</li>
</ul>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>The mission of Bytom is to bridge the digital world and the physical world, and to build a decentralized network where various digital and physical assets can be registered and exchanged. The goal of Bytom is to become the world’s largest dedicated public blockchain platform, connecting various asset classes to the blockchain, enhancing the liquidity, security, and value of theseassets.</p>

<p>Bytom will greatly promote the exchange and flow of “byte information” and “byte assets” with value attributes, and via contract and configuration create new “byte assets”. Bytom is also a type of intermediary, becoming an economic body generating profit from data and an amplifier to the performance of digital assets. In the future, these digital assets will not only be used in daily life, but can also be artificial intelligence, provide “digital food” for equipment in the Internet of Things, and to increase the influence of the digital world on the physical world.</p>

<h4>Bytom Native Assets</h4>

<p><b>1. Bytom Coin Basis of Value</b> - Bytom Coins are the native asset on the Bytom Blockchain. Bytom Coin’s value comes from its ability to easily characterize and measure the digital economic activity on the Bytom Blockchain. Bytom Coin represents both the ownership of the Bytom Blockchain and the right to use it: use of the Bytom Blockchain will incur a fee in Bytom Coin, reflecting the right of usage characteristic of Bytom Coin; holding Bytom Coins represents owning a piece of the Bytom Blockchain, essentially being a shareholder of the Bytom Blockchain, and therefore able to participate in the highest-level governance of the Bytom Blockchain, reflecting Bytom Coin’s ownership characteristic.</p>

<center><img src="/images/bytom-103.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<p><b>2. Distribution of Bytom Coin</b> - Bytom Blockchain’s tokens: Bytom Coin (English Symbol BTM), total of 2.1 billion, split in the following</p>

<p>way:</p>

<p>Bytom Coin Distribution</p>

<p>Allocation</p>

<p><b>Private Equity Investors</b></p>

<p>7%</p>

<p><b>ICO Distribution</b></p>

<p>30%</p>

<b>Reserved for Bytom Foundation</b>

<p>20%</p>

<p><b>Business Development</b></p>

<p>10%</p>

<p><b>Mining</b></p>

<p>33%</p>

<p>7% of Bytom Coin will be distributed to Private Equity investors including angel investors and institutions. Primarily for providing resources and technical expertise in early development.</p>

<center><img src="/images/bytom-110.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<p>30% of Bytom Coin will be distributed during the ICO. The BTC/ETH received during the public sale will be used for funding startup operations of Bytom Blockchain including development, <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-bitcoin-q-and-a-bitcoins-during-a-hard-fork/">cryptographic audits</a>, marketing, legal, financial affairs, third-party audits, as well as the initial computing power needed to deploy the blockchain.</p>

<p>20% will be reserved for the Bytom Foundation. This amount will be used for project development incentives; furthermore, upon successful completion of the ICO these funds will be frozen for one year. Afterwards the funds will be unfrozen over four years with 5% unfrozen each year. At the same time, the initial hash power deployed through funding by the Bytom Foundation will also act as incentive for development operations and the continued support of Bytom Coin.</p>

<p>10% will be reserved for Bytom Coin business development. Business development funds will mainly be used to pay exchange listing fees for Bytom Coin, developing commercial applications of the technological standard, maintaining the ecosystem of the Bytom Blockchain, and so on.</p>

<p>33% will be reserved for mining rewards. Bytom Blockchain consensus operates by the POW mechanism, mining rewards will halve every four years until no new mining block reward is produced. In the first four years from when Bytom Blockchain is released, 86.625 million Bytom Coins will be mined each year. In years five through eight 43.3125 million Bytom Coins will be mined each year, and so on. 1‰ of Bytom Blockchain mining yields will be donated to foundations and non-profit organizations researching the ethics of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With Bytom</h2>

<p>Bytom is an interactive protocol of multiple byte assets. Heterogeneous byte-assets (indigenous digital currency, digital assets) that operate in different forms on the Bytom Blockchain and atomic assets (warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract-based interoperations via Bytom.</p>

<h4>Technique </h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Compatible with the UTXO model</b> - Bytom consists of three layers: data transaction and transmission layer, contract layer and asset interaction layer.</li>

<li><b>General address format</b> - BIP32, BIP43 and BIP441are used in the design of Bytom wallet to provide support for multi-currency, multi-account, multi-address and multi-key with Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (or "HD Wallets").</li>

<li><b>Compatible with National Encryption Standard</b> - The asset management and operation of Bytom involves private key, public key and address system, which is achieved through ESCDA encryption and SHA256 hashing in Bitcoin’s design. Bytom will support the Public Key Cryptographic Algorithm SM2 Based on Elliptic Curves 2 and SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm 3 that are compliant with Chinese National standard. In terms of similar computational complexity, SM2 is much faster than RSA and DSA in processing private keys, thus a higher efficiency in encryption. The compression function of SM3 algorithm has similar structure to that of SHA-256. But the design of SM3 algorithm is more complicated. For example, two message words are used for each round of compression function.</li>

<li><b>POW algorithm that is friendly to AI ASIC-chips</b> - Use a new POW algorithm</li>

<li><b>Asset naming using ODIN</b> - The naming of assets will follow ODIN (Open Data Index Name) standards to ensure the uniqueness of assets across the entire network and blockchain.</li>

<li><b>Separate transaction signatures from the rest of the data in a transaction</b> - In Bytom’s design, there is a DLT protocol that allows interaction between a variety of assets.</li>

<li><b>Enhanced trading flexibility</b> - Unlike the Ethereum account model, BUTXO can verify transactions in parallel by adopting a mechanism similar to nonce to ensure that each unspent outputs could only be quoted by one transaction.</li>

<li><b>Cross-chain asset dividends distribution through side-chain</b> - Developers can create a tiny version of the X chain (other blockchains) or Xrelay based on Bytom platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants of the Bytom Blockchain ICO, please carefully read the Bytom Blockchain technical white paper and economic white paper, comprehensively recognize the risks of the Bytom Blockchain ICO investment characteristics and technical characteristics, consider one’s own personal risk tolerance, and use rational judgment and careful decision making. ICO participants should understand that the Bytom Blockchain project will not provide refunds under anycircumstances.</p>

<center><img src="/images/bytom-107.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<p>The Bytom Blockchain project team will follow the published white paper contents, use the crypto funds raised by the ICO rationally, standardize project management, and fulfill their duties with honesty and trustworthiness, and diligently and responsibly manage their obligations, but even so the buyer is subject to the risk of loss. The risks include the following:</p>

<p><b>1. Policy Risk</b> - Since the State Regulators haven ’ t made a clear and specific regulations towards ICO, the ICO market may fluctuate with the changing of policies and regulations, from which ICO inventors may suffer loses.</p>

<p><b>2. Economic Cycle Risk</b> - The development of ICO project and digital assets management may be directly or indirectly affected due to economic cycle. We will adjust the speed of development accordingly and release the achievements in time.</p>

<center><img src="/images/bytom-116.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<p><b>3. Hacker Risk</b> - Bytom team has built up the security structures to prevent external attack. While the attack methods of hackers and Trojan virus have been updated and evolved, it may threaten the development of project and digital assets management and bring unpredictable risk.</p>

<p><b>4. Technology Risk</b> - ICO project has been proved its feasibility in concept design at the beginning and published part of the code structure and milestone design. However, it doesn ’ t mean the development won ’ t be affected by insufficient estimates of technology test and roadmap.</p>

<p><b>5. Token Risk</b> - The recognition of Bytom token may be limited by the users and market. The final acceptability and popularity is not certain when Bytom passes the tests and goes online. Bytom token doesn’t represent any rights and interests of token owners. Bytom team won’t buy back or make any commitment to the profits.</p>

<p><b>6. Price Risk</b> - After Bytom enters digital assets exchange market, the price may fluctuate dramatically due to the 24-hour trade and manipulation of market makers and universal government policies, which is unlike the price limits mechanism of stock market in China. Therefore, Bytom team won ’ t give any express warranty or hint towards the price and value of Bytom. Owners are supposed to know that digital assets exchange market is unsteady and price and value may fluctuate greatly and even crash.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<center><img src="/images/bytom-108.jpg" alt="bytom"></center>

<p>Users are supposed to consider carefully about the risks above, evaluate carefully about Bytom Project, make investments according to your own financial conditions and the ability to handle risk and then take all of the responsibilities that you may lose.</p>
