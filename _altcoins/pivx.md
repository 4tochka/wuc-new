<p><h1 id="introduction"><b>PIVX INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
<p>PIVX is a multifaceted community-centric endeavor in the blockchain tech and cryptocurrency realms.
<p>There are many components of what and who PIVX is and why PIVX was manifested.
<p>At the core, PIVX is designed, engineered, and evolving with the best practices and developments to ensure your store of value, transactional security, privacy and fungibility.
<p>You have the right to exchange privately and securely, without interference from corporatocracy pressures, governmental influences, prying eyes, and nefarious individuals and movements.
<p>In this modern age itâ€™s time to allow individuals to exchange and use their wealth how and when they want, with a peace of mind that their transactions are occurring in a rapid fashion, and in a private and verified manner.
<p>Launched on Feb 1st, 2016 under the name of Darknet (DNET), after developments and increased community involvement, it was decided to professionally rebrand and officially change the name to PIVX to more accurately reflect the underpinnings of the community ideals and ideologies being hard coded into the cryptocurrency.
<p>The main goal of PIVX is to achieve near instant private transactions and a governance that helps sustain the network for the benefit of all of the users involved.
<p>While PIVX is well on its way to achieving this, some of the features are under development and should appear in the near future.
<p><h3 id="staking">Optimized PIVX Staking</h3>
<p>When staking, the <b>larger the address balance the more will be earned</b>.
<p>For example, an address with about 15,000 PIVX will earn about 50% more per PIVX than an address with about 1,000 PIVX.
<p>Masternodes may earn more but there is a lot of hassle setting up and running them.
<p>You can estimate earnings with <a href="http://cryptonode.co/">Cryptonode</a>.
<p>The wallet needs to be opened and unlocked while connected to the Internet; so be careful with security.
<p>Addresses need to have at least 100 confirmations.
<p>Crazy Pro Tip - After an address gets 100 confirmations then restart the wallet and unlock it. Then the staking should be active for that balance.
