  dash-pivx: The DASH v. PIVX Comparision

<p>The PIVX ecosystem has an very interesting blend of governance. Like DASH it has masternodes but it also implements Proof of Stake.
<p>This creates some very interesting financial and economic incentives.

<p><h3 id="staking">Optimized PIVX Staking</h3>
<p>When staking, the <b>larger the address balance the more will be earned</b>.
<p>For example, an address with about 15,000 PIVX will earn about 50% more per PIVX than an address with about 1,000 PIVX.
<p>Masternodes may earn more but there is a lot of hassle setting up and running them.
<p>You can estimate earnings with <a href="http://cryptonode.co/">Cryptonode</a>.
<p>The wallet needs to be opened and unlocked while connected to the Internet; so be careful with security.
<p>Addresses need to have at least 100 confirmations.
<p>Crazy Pro Tip - After an address gets 100 confirmations then restart the wallet and unlock it. Then the staking should be active for that balance.
