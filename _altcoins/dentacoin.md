<h2 id="what">What Is Dentacoin?</h2>

<p><center><script type="text/javascript" src="https://files.coinmarketcap.com/static/widget/currency.js"></script><div class="coinmarketcap-currency-widget" data-currency="dentacoin" data-base="USD" data-secondary="BTC" data-ticker="true" data-rank="true" data-marketcap="true" data-volume="true" data-stats="USD" data-statsticker="false"></div></center></p>

<p>Dentacoin (DCN) is the main blockchain idea intended to help make the worldwide dental industry more reasonable. Following a decentralized, <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-ethereum-and-smart-contracts/">Ethereum-based smart contract</a> convention, the DCN token prizes clients through a framework that moves group commitment. At last, the task's main goal is to influence quality dental wellbeing to mind accessible to the about 80% of the total populace without it. </p>

<p>By expelling the go between (huge insurance agencies) and putting specialist once again into patient's/dental specialist's hands, expenses can be essentially diminished. One way this is refined is through the foundation of savvy contracts specifically amongst patients and dental practitioners. These encourage little month to month commitments of Dentacoin to dental practitioners.

<p>As indicated by the American Dental Association, the normal American pays $544 in out-of-take costs. Also, almost 90% of expenses can be maintained a strategic distance from just if patients take preemptive care and visit the dental specialist no less than 3 times each year. The issue is, heading off to the dental specialist isn't the most charming of encounters for the normal individual, and less visits connect with higher examples of gum infection, cavities, and so forth. </p>

<center><img src="/images/dentacoin-104.jpg" alt="dentacoin"></center>

<p>With Dentacoin, patients are engaged to take control of their preemptive dental care, (for example, appropriate sustenance/flossing) and dental practitioners advantage fiscally from patient's long haul dental achievement. Shockingly, the present dental framework doesn't urge dental specialists to think about the long haul advantages to patients (because of financial detriments) and rather center around here and now esteem. </p>

<p>Today, the worldwide dental treatment industry is esteemed around $400 billion dollars, yet accompanies high-cost obstructions for both littler organizations and patients. With a specific end goal to break into this industry, the Dentacoin Foundation is depending on the energy of crowdfunding to outfit its objectives.</p>

<h4>Key Features of Dentacoin</h4>

<p>Dentacoin is both a money related tech device and coordinations stage. Not at all like numerous other decentralized p2p (shared) digital currencies available (like <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin</a>), the Dentacoin token isn't expected to be the new means for worldwide installments. Rather, it's seen as a non-aggressive cryptographic money which will exclusively center around advancing the worldwide dental industry. In spite of the fact that rethinking the business demonstrates testing, Dentacoin diagrams a progression of instruments to better represent the group's objectives: </p>

<p><b>Blockchain Based Trusted Review Platform:</b>Stage empowering persistent surveys to be distributed in a fair way, making ideal statistical surveying an incentive for dental practitioners. Surveys are compensated with DCN, which thus can be utilized to pay for future medications. </p>

<center><img src="/images/dentacoin-105.jpg" alt="dentacoin"></center>

<p><b>Dentacare Mobile App:</b>Offers a three-month boosted gaming program that instructs clients (e.g. arrangement updates, brushing strategies, healthful direction) on the best way to keep up legitimate dental cleanliness. Following three months, the expectation is that these monotonous, helpful cleanliness activities turn out to be for all time coordinated into the person's standard.

Financial prizes are given to the two gatherings if these commitments are met. "Super savvy contracts" will likewise be executed to ensure the patient if there should be an occurrence of dental specialist bankruptcy or demise. </p>

<p><b>Healthcare Database:</b>The <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-qa-anonymity-and-confidential-transactions/">blockchain offers secure information trade</a> while all the while enabling capacity of therapeutic records to be shared among dental practitioners and patients (upon given consent). </p>

<p><b>Trading Platform:</b>Evacuating protracted supply chains, dental items and hardware can be exchanged overall utilizing DCN. This keeps away from unreasonable levies and fluctuating trade rates.</p>

<h4>How Does Dentacoin Work?</h4>

<p>To see how Dentacoin functions, it comprehends the idea of keen contracts. The tasks whitepaper likewise gives a decent clarification of keen contracts, portraying them as "PC conventions in the Ethereum blockchain that encourage, confirm, arrange and finish up contracts amongst people and their contracting party." </p>

<p>This may sound confounded to those not in the tech business or new to digital currency, however a straightforward method to think about the DCN shrewd contract is to relate it to the handling of a check. Somebody composes a particular sum on the check with their name and mark, the check is then conveyed to the bank who "clears" it, and the proposed recipient is given the cash. Just if every one of these conditions are met can the exchange be effective. </p>

<center><img src="/images/dentacoin-106.jpg" alt="dentacoin"></center>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Likewise with DCN savvy gets, a series of occasions must happen and commitments filled, (for example, a consummation of an administration) before DCN's can be exchanged. However, you needn't bother with a bank or go between to confirm that commitments are met. Thank heaven for keen contracts! </p>

<p>In addition, clients can send or ask for DCN tokens to any Ethereum based wallet. The two gatherings partaking in DCN exchanges will have the capacity to see their exchange history on the record with finish straightforwardness and also see account adjusts in the agreements ceaselessly refreshed state.</p>

<h2 id="earn">How To Earn Dentacoin?</h2>

<p>Dentacoin’s 'unique feedback platform will be supported by various other valuecreating solutions devoted to achieving the same purpose -to improve dental care quality worldwide-. The revolutionary, blockchain dental insurance will become one of Dentacoin’s most powerful tools in the dental industry, as explained below. </p>

<p>Dentacoin has created a uniquely original dental insurance smart contract that will exist between the individual and their corresponding dentist in order to achieve the 10 above-mentioned purpose. If agreed upon by both parties, the contract becomes tradable within the blockchain, this allows for the creation of value to be held by the contract. </p>

<p>All smart contracts in existence will form part of a "super smart contract". "Super smart contracts" ensure that the patient is covered in the case of insolvency or death of the dentist. The smart contract focuses on the alignment of both parties' main interest - to maintain healthy teeth and overall oral hygiene. By entering into the smart contract, both the dentist and patient have obligations and duties to fulfil, upon completion, both parties will reap the benefits of the smart contract. </p>

<p>Patients must attain the oral hygiene and care that is set out in the Dentacare mobile app and dentists, who restore and maintain their patients’ teeth at their own expense, are to perform their job to the utmost quality and satisfaction. </p>

<p>If both parties' duties and obligations are met, monetary rewards will be issued. This monetary motivation method creates an environment where both parties whilst performing to reach a common goal are simultaneously benefitting themselves and the dental industry as high levels of personal health are met as well as a high quality performance from the dentists.</p>

<p>Blockchain offers a model, which has the potential to enable secure lifetime medical record sharing across all healthcare providers. The rationale for considering a blockchain in electronic health care records is twofold. First, it avoids adding another organization between the patient and the records.</p> 

<center><img src="/images/dentacoin-111.jpg" alt="dentacoin"></center>

<p>The blockchain implies a decentralized control mechanism in which all have an interest, but no one exclusively owns it. This is an architectural change that generalizes past medical records. Second, it adds due consideration to a time-stamped, programmable ledger. That opens the door for intelligent control of record access without having to create custom functionality for each vendor. The ledger also inherently includes an audit trail.</p>

<h2 id="spend">Where To Spend Dentacoin?</h2>

<p>The Dentacoin Foundation recognizes that the value of all user contributions (reviews, recommendations, rewards, payments, trusted feedback, etc.) is one of the most important assets to the foundation. A single review is worth next to nothing, but millions of trusted and impartial reviews are worth many millions (or possibly even billions) of euros. </p>

<p>Individuals should be paid for everything they do that brings value not only to Dentacoin but also to the dental industry. A major breakthrough for Dentacoin was the purchase of a real existing dental clinic, the Dentaprime International Plc. London. The transfer of ownership took place in July 2017 once the purchase price had been paid. </p>

<p>This transaction was phenomenal due to the fact that the calculated purchase price to the value of 90 million USD was paid entirely in DCN. This means that even before the ICO, the DCN was given a high, real value by professionals of the M&A field. This purchase is unique in the history of the blockchain tokens. The Dentacoin Foundation will continue to be active in M&A and will purchase additional clinics if they can take a pilot function within Dental Industry 4.0. 17 Possibility of Indirect Profit Sharing</p>

<p>Once a year, there is a possibility that the Dentacoin Foundation will be able to change back the Dentacoin tokens from market for Ether or Bitcoin with up to 50% of the operating profit. This will have the effect that the global DCN supply decreases. On the other hand, the Dentacoin Foundation may use the 50% of the operating profit to reinvest into the tools that are being developed by the Dentacoin Foundation. </p>

<p>The decision how to use the resources - including any profits and liquidation proceeds - will be only and at every time in the hands of the management of the foundation. The operating profit includes interests from assets, profits of the clinics bought by the Foundation and any other return on investment.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>There are 8,000,000,000,000 (eight trillion) coins. A “DCN” refers to one individual Dentacoin and because it is an ERC20 token, it is configured to be used globally by all individuals and its value is derived from the exchange with Ether. The symbol ٨ has been chosen to represent a DCN.</p>

<h2 id="mining">What Is Dentacoin Mining?</h2>

<p>Dentacoin Review Platform aims at being the most functional review and market research system ever, due to the transparent, incentive-based and censorship resistant nature of our blockchain based solution. Through a self-executing Ethereum Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety. No review manipulations are possible.</p>

<p>Dentacoin’s one-of-a-kind feedback platform will be supported by various other value-creating solutions devoted to the same purpose – to improve dental care quality worldwide. These include: a dental insurance model, a healthcare database, an aftercare mobile app, an educational website.</p>

<p>Dentacoin token is produced in a limited amount of 8 trillion Dentacoins (8 000 000 000 000 DCN). The distribution mechanism doesn’t allow for more Dentacoins to be produced ever, nor can more Dentacoins be mined.</p>

<p>Dentacoins can be owned by earning and buying.</p>

<p>Earning happens at our Partner Clinics, as part of their Loyalty Program. In the near future, when our supporting tools are developed, there will be more ways to earn Dentacoins.</p>

<p>On 1st of July we launch an Exclusive hard-capped Presale which allows early adopters to buy Dentacoins around 2.5 times cheaper for people who support from the very beginning our Mission to improve Dental Care quality worldwide by giving the power to the hands of the people.</p>
