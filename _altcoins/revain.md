<h2 id="what">What Is Revain?</h2>

<center><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhhsjo6t64Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Using <a href="/blockchain-explained-for-normal-people/">blockchain technology</a>, we managed to create an economic model, which allows common users to stay highly motivated because of our token - RVN. Using the second token - R and nonlinear conversion mechanism, Revain acquired an absolutely stable internal token. And finally, due to Ethereum platform, we were able to create a transparent system, guaranteeing immutability and incorruptibility.</p>

<h4>Network Effect</h4>

<p><b>Authentic feedback</b> - Revain will create automatic artificial intelligence review filtration system. KYC will give companies confidence in getting authentic feedback from the market.</p>

<p><b>Authentic feedback</b> - With development of M2M (machine-to-machine) relationships the world is going to need a base of authentic human opinions and wisdom of the crowd for computers, because it has none. Revain will help.</p>

<p><b>Market research</b> - The real problem for today's review market is fake reviews and rating manipulation. Revain has аsolution.</p>

<p><b>Social regulation</b> - Reviews might actually help to regulate the market. Companies with bad reviews and rating will get less clients without improving the product, but the market will help companies with good reviews to gain popularity.</p>

<h4>Why you should use Revain?</h4>

<p><b>Artificial intelligence</b> - Our service is developed in close collaboration with hi-tech IBM AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Stable token</b> - RVN token, inner platform currency, isn’t volatile at all.</p>

<p><b>Review's immutability</b> - Due to blockchain technology and <a href="/video-new-eea-members/">Ethereum platform</a> especially, all the reviews can't be deleted or changed.</p>

<p><b>Rewards</b> - Users get a reward in our tokens for every review. The only requirement - the review should pass filtration stage.</p>

<p><b>Automatic filtration</b> - We're using machine learning and neural networks for detecting all types of unwarranted texts: spam, flood, abuse, etc.</p>

<p><b>Unbiased system</b> - We’re creating a system that doesn’t need a user to trust a platform to perform any actions. DAO and smart-contracts will defend it from any kinds of fake reviews.</p>

<p><b>Transparency</b> - Anyone can check all the reviews or transactions. Also, we have public Github page so that you can explore our code! https:/github.com/Revain</p>

<p><b>Quality feedback</b> - Improve your product and business processes by getting a real experience of hundreds of your users.</p>

<h4>Architecture</h4>

<p><b>WEB APPLICATION</b> - Our interface provides simple and comfortable work with all platform features made for all devices.</p>

<p><b>R TOKEN</b> - Crowdfunding instrument made on the Ethereum blockchain. 70% of tokens will be sold during the crowdsale.</p>

<p><b>RVN TOKEN</b> - This token is designed to be stable inner currency. All the operations inside the platform use RVN, so all the costs will be fixed.</p>

<p><b>RSS (REVIEW SNAPSHOT STORAGE)</b> - Independent storage, based on Ethereum smart-contract. It allows anyone to check all the reviews, which were written on our platform.</p>

<p><b>RSS (REVIEW SNAPSHOT STORAGE)</b> - Independent storage, based on Ethereum smart-contract. It allows anyone to check all the reviews, which were written on our platform.</p>

<p>The main target of the blockchain technology is to bring transparency and reliability to several industries and to improve the way they work.</p>

<p>In the era of e-commerce, we mainly rely on reviews to decide to buy products, book travels and other services. Thanks to this, the online and mobile user experience is improved, actually. Think about choosing the right seller on eBay, the right hotel or restaurant on Tripadvisor, the right product on Amazon, today we all strongly rely on reviews to buy online. A healthy environment should create “social regulation” with good companies to thrive and bad companies to abandon the market soon. In addition, honest companies can use authentic reviews and feedbacks by customers to improve their services and products.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Unfortunately, the e-commerce industry is plagued by fake reviews and  and rating manipulation. Some positive reviews are written by robots, so that the consumer cannot understand if a review is written by a person or Artificial Intelligence. In addition, negative reviews are often deleted by business and sites owners. All of this jeopardizes the entire online world, ruining the reliability of honest businesses, elevating companies offering lower-level products and services and shattering the online experience of buyers.</p>

<p>In order to solve this problem, Russian startup Revain is advancing a next-generation unbiased feedback platform, built in close collaboration with hi-tech IBM AI systems and based on blockchain technology, which doesn’t allow to change or delete reviews while authors get a reward for creating them.</p>

<p>Using blockchain technology, the company has created an economic model, which allows common users to stay motivated because of a token called RVN. Using a second token, called R, and a non-linear conversion mechanism, Revain acquired a stable internal token. The <a href="/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> platform finally enabled the company to create a transparent system, guaranteeing the immutability of the system, and all of the reviews can’t be deleted or changed.</p>

<p>The platform enables users to get a reward in tokens for every review that passes the filtration stage. By using machine learning and neural networks, the system detects all types of unwarranted texts such as spam, flood, abuse, etc. while DAO and smart-contracts defend it from any kinds of fake reviews. The transparency is granted by the fact that anyone can check all the reviews or transactions and that the company has opened a public Github page so that people can explore its code.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With Revain</h2>

<p>As we move closer towards a tokenized society where users of websites and services pay in or are rewarded in digital cryptocurrency, it’s natural that the future of businesses reviews on the blockchain will begin by offereing reviews on digital assets.</p>

<p>Revain recently announced a strategic partnership to build a system to review new ICO projects.</p>

<p>“In partnership with ICOrating.com, Revain will allow users to review the most important elements of an ICO, including its business model, market segment, team, competition, technical background, and community reviews,” Revain announced on Medium.</p>

<p>Currently it is very difficult to determine a scammy initial coin offering (ICO) from a solid project. Some are looking to government regulations as the guidelines for legitimate ICOs. Early Bitcoin adopter and altcoin supporter Overstock.com recently launched an SEC-compliant ICO platform.</p>

<p>Yet the spirit of cryptocurrency is to remain permissionless. While the SEC compliance may provide some investors with a warm and fuzzy feeling, crypto-anarchists may seek a more market-based solution to analyze good projects from bad ones.</p>

<p>As an ICO participant, it’s crucial to scrutinize the technology, the team, the token distribution plan, the problem it aims to solve, its competition, its challenges and more.</p>
 
<p>Here’s a brief checklist of some key factors to examine when reviewing an ICO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Utility & Unique Features</li>
<li>Asset Details (token supply cap, distribution)</li>
<li>Technology (algorithm, security, scalability)</li>
<li>Incentives (sustainability)</li>
<li>Infrastructure & Ecosystem (website, wallets, exchanges, etc)</li>
<li>ICO Details (or asset performance)</li>
<li>Advantages & Challenges (pros and cons)</li>
<li>Roadmap & Official Resources</li>
</ul>

<p>You may weigh those factors differently when analyzing a project, but it’s wise to consider each one of them. Even many of the solid crypto projects will fail. Just like in any other industry. That’s why it’s extra important to do your due diligence before contibuting to any cryptocurrency launch or digital asset crowdfunder.</p>

<p>REVAIN offers its users an incentive to write lengthy audits or criticisms. Unlike its competitors, REVAIN utilizes blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to pay its commenters for their feedback at restaurants, shops, e-commerce, cryptocurrency services, and ICOs.</p>

<p>“Having an official ICO rating system with an investment potential score, as well as an in-depth overview of a beta ICO, would heighten buyer potential and promote more transactions based on a higher sense of security and trust,” Revain added.</p>

<p>REVAIN’s pre-concept architecture is made up of a web-interface where users interact with an independent reviews database built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<center><img src="/images/revain-101.jpg" alt="revain"></center>

<p>The REVAIN cryptocurrency model is unique they use two cryptocurrencies one inside the platform (RVN) and one that will be tradable on exchanges (R-TOKEN). This helps to stabilize the value of the RVN cryptocurrency on the inside of the program limiting volatility. Which will, in turn, have a set value.</p>

<p>But the real shining part of REVAIN is its automatic filtration system partnered with IBM WATSON hi-tech IBM AI systems for detecting all types of unwarranted texts: spam, flood, abuse, etc. This allows a user to submit a review and the system approves or denies a submission depending on a number of factors within the algorithm leaving no room for human manipulation.</p>

<p>After the reviews are accepted, they can’t be deleted or changed. Although, they will offer the companies a chance to appeal the review if they give a good enough reason. The original review will stay with an additional comment “this review was disputed,” with a message from the business in question.</p>

<p>As for the product itself, users can expect to first test a version of REVAIN this fall. The release of the platform is planned for the fourth quarter of 2017.</p>

<p>The company seeks to focus on authenticating online reviews for businesses and customers alike, eradicating fake reviews and any deletion of genuine negative customer reviews. Offering the user and business alike a service like a paid version of Yelp. Watch the video below for an overview:</p>

<h2 id="howto">How To Get A Revain Wallet?</h2>

<p>The pace at which technology advances is hard to keep up with. Businesses are looking for ways to adapt and exploit innovative technology in different ways. ICOs are the embodiment of how businesses are using blockchain technology to raise funds, create a user base and make their services more efficient. However, it seems that technology is even out-pacing itself. Many ICOs that would have been trail-blazers in their respective industries a few months ago, are already losing their allure. It seems that the next step for businesses is to integrate innovative tech into a single platform.</p>

<h4>ICOs Integrate IoT</h4>

<p>Probably the most notorious project that is integrating blockchain technology – although <a href="/bitcoin-ledger-wallet-review/">distributed ledger technology</a> would be a more suitable term – with another budding technology field is <a href="/what-is-iota/">IOTA</a>. This project aims to enable the trading of technological resources, effectively integrating IoT resources to an open market place. Businesses will be able to use these IoT resources by paying for them on a distributed ledger that has built-in consensus. Therefore, transaction fees will be non-existent.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<h4>Integration of New Technology is the Key to the Next Business Wave</h4>

<p>IOTA will also allow users to store and use data from devices within the system. The integrative nature of this project will allow businesses to enter a new era and create new business models on top of data and device sharing, as well as friction-less transactions. This shows that the next crop of ICOs will have to start thinking about integration of new technologies, instead of simply thinking about new business models and technology deployment. Some ICOs have already started doing this, venturing into other fields that can transform the way we conduct business today.</p>

<h4>Blockchain + AI: The New Frontier</h4>

<p>Many of the ICOs that are jumping onto the next business wave, are exploring the integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence – or AI. In this realm, possibilities are infinite. From applications in law enforcement to additional layers of integration with IoT and even digital marketing, blockchain + AI looks like the new frontier ahead. ICOs looking to integrate these technologies will transform the way we interact with our surroundings completely.</p>

<h4>What is AI and How Can Businesses Integrate it With Blockchain Technology?</h4>

<p>But, what is AI and how does it fit within this integration scheme that will fuel future businesses in every aspect? Simply put, AI is the development of systems that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can be broken down into 3 distinct vectors according to Neil Jacobstein:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine Learning.</li>
<li>Curated Knowledge.</li>
<li>Reverse Engineering of the Brain.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The first and second vectors are probably the ones ICOs and other blockchain projects will start integrating immediately to enhance their products and services.</p>

<h4>Exploring Each Vector and its Potential for Blockchain Integration</h4>

<p>This is due to the fact that they are the most widely available AI vectors, and also constitute the ones that can immediately enhance the work that ICOs and other blockchain projects are developing right now. To understand why vectors 1 and 2 are more likely to be used in the immediate future as opposed to vector 3, it is useful to understand the function they have within AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vector number 1, Machine Learning, is a system of hierarchical pattern recognition for the optimization of tasks.</li>
<li>The second vector, Curated Knowledge, is the re-engineering of an expert’s problem-solving patterns that reduces a given problem to something a computer can solve. This vector is especially useful when knowledge is static.</li>
<li>AI’s third vector, Reverse Engineering of the Brain, is about mapping brain functions and how they are carried out to emulate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain technology can be immediately integrated with vector 1 systems, and to a lesser extent, with vector 2 systems. The rising symbiotic relation between these 2 AI vectors and blockchain technology, is especially interesting considering that distributed ledgers produce troves of data and meta-data that could feed vector 1 and vector 2 systems automatically and openly, providing a myriad of opportunities for the systems to learn and improve with every task.</p>

<h4>Revain Integrating Blockchain and AI</h4>

<p>One example of this new crop of ICOs looking to benefit from the integration of blockchain and AI technology along vector 1, is Revain. This ICO is aiming to apply the benefits of integrating both technologies to keep online reviews as objective as possible. Revain will allow users to get feedback from their peers on other ICO projects, tokens, cryptocurrencies and more, using vector 1 AI systems to recognize patterns within the reviews and filter skewed reviews out. The information will then be stored on an immutable blockchain, allowing people to compare the reviews with the information they get from other sources to make more objective decisions.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>At the same time, applied machine learning within the Revain platform will get better at identifying patterns in skewed reviews to filter them out more precisely and faster, as the information on the blockchain grows. The review platform itself will also be subject to constant improvement through user reviews and feedback on exiting reviews. Revain does not aim to replace human input with AI input; its objective is to enhance user input using AI filtering. This way, the more the platform is used, the better the AI component will become at filtering, and the more value users will be able to unlock from the information they will get.</p>

<h4>The Future ICO is Here</h4>

<p>Many other ICOs are also joining this integrative trend, pushing their projects beyond the benchmarks the markets are already used to. In a matter of months, the most appealing ICOs will probably have a blockchain component along with another technological component, be it AI, IoT or any other budding technology field. New business models, new products and new services will increasingly look at integration as their most efficient route to innovation, and a way to keep up with the pace of technological advancement. This new crop of ICOs will become the rule.</p>

<h2 id="buy">How To Buy Revain?</h2>

<p>Tell your neighborhood soccer mom to put down Yelp and to get her hands on a Revain token. This first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency is looking to create a platform in which users are able to submit honest, unaltered and indisputable reviews about products, services and even emerging tokens in the crypto market.</p>

<p>Companies all over the world rely on customer reviews to generate revenue, and customers rely heavily on feedback as it allows them to decide which products or services to purchase. Companies recognize the power of that feedback, and have enlisted the help of other companies to manage their reputation. This can be dangerous, as some tend to manipulate their review section by either deleting negative posts, or posting fake positive ones.</p>

<h4>How will Revchain guarantee authenticity?</h4>

<p>Using secure and encrypted blockchain technology, Revchain ensures reviews won’t be altered or deleted. Users will be restricted to 5 reviews per day, which protects from mass registration and overspending, as they will also receive benefits from every written review. On top of that, Revchain will use a two-step verification process:</p>
<ul>
<li>One using Artificial Intelligence technology</li>
<li>The second being manually</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you eager to start reviewing? We are too, let’s help you buy some Revchain tokens.</p>

<h4>Open Up A Coinbase Account</h4>

<p>The first step is simple: Buy yourself some <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> or <a href="/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> from <a href="http://geni.us/coinbase">Coinbase</a>. If you are unable to get into Coinbase, try buying the coins through Coinmama — the guide will be the same. If you already have some BTC or ETH on you, you get to skip forward to step 2.</p>

<h4>Create A Kucoin.io Account</h4>

<p>Buying those BTC or ETH is a crucial step, as you will be using them to buy other coins in a cryptocurrency marketplace. Revchain tokens are pretty popular, so you can buy them from a variety of marketplaces. But, for today’s tutorial, we will be using <a href="/what-is-kucoin/">Kucoin</a>. Create an account with Kucoin and move on to step 3.</p>

<h4>Send BTC or ETH to Kucoin</h4>

<p>Don’t worry if, at first glance, these steps confuse you. They’re actually pretty simple. All we need to do is transfer our BTC or ETH from our <a href="http://geni.us/coinbase">Coinbase wallet</a> to our Kucoin wallet. Here’s how we’ll do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <b>“Wallets” </b>on Kucoin.io</li>
<li>Locate your <b>“BTC”</b> or <b>“ETH”</b></li>
<li>Tap on <b>“Deposit”</b></li>
<li>Select and copy the address</li>
<li>Open up Coinbase once more</li>
<li>Press the <b>“Accounts”</b> label on Coinbase</li>
<li>Search for your BTC or ETH wallet & select <b>“Send”</b></li>
<li>Move the Kucoin wallet address into the Coinbase recipient address bar</li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to send and then just send!</li>
</ul>
<p>That wasn’t so bad, was it? Here are some screenshots that help illustrate the process using ETH as an example:</p>

<h4>Buy Revain (R) on Kucoin</h4>

<p>You’re getting closer to those Revain tokens now! Drag your mouse over the “Markets” tab and look for the BTC/R or ETH/R market. Once you’re here, you have to determine your price per coin, the number of coins you want to purchase, and then finally buy them!</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot that demonstrates where to buy on the page:</p>

<h4>Calculate & Collect</h4>

<p>And that’s it! You now have some Revain tokens in your wallet and it’s entirely your choice to decide what to do with them. A lot of crypto investors let them sit in their wallets, but others also go back to the marketplace to make other purchases.</p>

<h2 id="latest">Latest Revain News</h2>

<h4>Revain announces Dashboard’s next major version 0.6 as the platform hits 1000 reviews</h4>

<center><img src="/images/revain-103.jpg" alt="revain"></center>

<p>As financial services warn us there will likely be more crypto-related crime in 2018, we are working as hard as ever to increase our security and give our users as much opportunity to make an impact as ever. We are thrilled to be able to deliver the more good news, more safety and security, and more functionality to our users. Revain has just been upgraded to version 0.6.</p>

<p><b>See it here</b></p>

<p>In a market choc-a-bloc full of carefully constructed images designed to extract monetary value out of customers by any means necessary, we deliver a service that allows establishing the real value of goods and services. We allow our customers to get straight to the point and see all of the product or service’s features rather than only those that the company that delivers them wants the client to see.</p>

<p>We love doing what we do, and the feeling is mutual: our clients are equally enthusiastic: we have just reached a milestone of 1000 reviews!</p>

<center><img src="/images/revain-104.jpg" alt="revain"></center>

<p>For that reason, we have made the service even more effective and easy to use with a launch of numerous new features. This release includes a list of exchanges, which we have been working for eons to introduce. With over 80% of reviews today fabricated, we had to employ a variety of means of due diligence checks. They are:</p>

<p>Exchanges are a tremendous part of the <a href="/bitcoin-venture-investing/">business of cryptocurrencies</a>. For example, Binance processes $1 741 091 796 every day! Exchanges are now available to review, comment on, and analyze for the crypto community's benefit. Revain is firmly set on adding more exchanges in the future.</p>

<p><b>Our ranking system</b></p>

<p>If you’re sending your child to a University, you want them to go to the best one. But how do you know which one is the best? We have ranking systems that will help you sort the best from the rest. According to every user's reviews, the system sets projects in order of the quality, integrity, and demand they provide for our users. The system, like everything else, is based on users’ input and reflects the current consensus on the best projects around. With more growing concerns about scams and frauds in the course of 2018, it is as important as ever to be in the know on who is proved to be the most trustworthy.</p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p><b>More security</b></p>

<p>Communication is the key, and your peace of mind is our first priority. Our Proof-of-Reviewing Feature will allow users to benefit from even more ways of staying safe. When a user submits a review, they will receive a letter with Revain’s digital signature to verify the request has been submitted. Email confirmation allows to dispute any possible claims of your trustworthiness – or acts as proof in case you want to prove your case to someone. We plan on introducing as many levels of security as we can so that you can be as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p><b>Review stats</b></p>

<p>As additional means of engaging our users, we have introduced a feature which allows you to see how your reviews are doing. There’s no point in missing out on your input. After all, Revain’s mission is to change the world for the better, and this is accomplished by every user’s input, which is tremendously valuable to us. See how many likes your reviews have collected and how much people are reading them. The notifications will arrive by themselves. Probably the only feature around that is guaranteed to bring nothing but good news.</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous: convenience, accessibility, and efficiency</b></p>

<p>We have added more projects which will be waiting for reviews, totally reworked the review section on the pages of the projects to make it as convenient as possible and made mobile Dashboard more smooth to meet the growing demand of our customers.</p>
