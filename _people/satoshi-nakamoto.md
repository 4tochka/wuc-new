<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown person or persons who designed bitcoin and created its original reference implementation. As a part of the implementation, they also devised the first blockchain database. In the process they were the first to solve the double spending problem for digital currency.
<p>They were active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.</p>

<p>Nakamoto has claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5 April 1975. However, speculation about the true identity of Nakamoto has mostly focused on a number of cryptography and computer science experts of non-Japanese descent living in the United States and Europe including Nick Szabo, <a href="/dr-adam-back/">Adam Back</a> and others.</p>

<p>One person, Australian programmer Craig Steven Wright or Faketoshis, has claimed to be Nakamoto but is widely thought to be a fraud. He has offered no cryptographic proof of the claim.</p>
