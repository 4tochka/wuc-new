<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown person(s) who designed Bitcoin and created the original reference implementation thus implementing the first functional blockchain database and solving the double spending problem for digital currency.
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto was active in Bitcoin development until December 2010. Satoshi Nakamoto was born 5 April 1975.
<p>However, speculation regarding Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity has mostly focused on cryptography and computer science experts of non-Japanese descent living in the United States and Europe including Nick Szabo, <a href="/dr-adam-back/">Adam Back</a> and others.</p>
<p>Australian Craig Steven Wright, also known as Faketoshi, claimed to be Nakamoto but is widely thought to be a fraud. He has offered no cryptographic proof of the claim.</p>
