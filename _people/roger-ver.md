Roger Ver, sometimes known as _Bitcoin Jesus_ or controversially [Bitcoin Anti-Christ](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622) or Bitcoin Judas, is the owner of Bitcoin.com, and an investor in many of the world's largest Bitcoin companies. He started investing in bitcoins in early 2011 and bought his first bitcoins at around $1.00.

Roger is an ex-convict. He was sentenced to [10 months in federal prison for a felony](https://www.justice.gov/archive/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm) involving selling explosives on Ebay, storing large quantities in a multi-family apartment building and shipping explosives through the US mail.

## BCash

Roger owns and operates Bitcoin.com. He has mostly used this domain to promote BCash which was a result from a hard fork of the Bitcoin network in 1 August 2017.
