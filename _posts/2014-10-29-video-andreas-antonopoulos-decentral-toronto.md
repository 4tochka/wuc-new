<p>Andreas Antonopoulos is a public speaker, author, coder, entrepreneur, and one of the most prominent and well-respected figures in bitcoin. Of special note he recently appeared in <a href="/video-andreas-m-antonopoulos-educates-senate-of-canada-about-bitcoin/">front of the Canadian Senate</a> and gave an exceptionally articulate and knowledgeable speech advocating for Canadian legislators "to resist the temptation to apply centralized solutions to this decentralized network," and instead look into adopting decentralized regulatory tools like decentralized audits and algorithmic proof-of-reserves. </p>
