<p>With the rise of cryptocurrency has come increased governmental scrutiny and regulatory action.
<p>For some users who do not like being thoroughly monitored with a spiked Roto-Rooter the market has begun to develop solutions with DASH, PIVX, ZCash and Monero.
<p>Currently, the best option for privacy and anonymity along with price appreciation is probably PIVX.

<p>The coins, current price each and market capitalization.
<ol>
<li>DASH - $141.28 - $1.036B</li>
<li>Monero - $42.49 - $619m</li>
<li>ZCash - $233.80 - $339m</li>
<li>PIVX - $1.66 - $89m</li>
</ol>

<p>The ecosystem has an very interesting blend of governance. Like DASH it has masternodes but it also implements Proof of Stake.
<p><h3 id="staking">Optimized PIVX Staking</h3>
<p>When staking, the <b>larger the address balance the more will be earned</b>.
<p>For example, an address with about 15,000 PIVX will earn about 50% more per PIVX than an address with about 1,000 PIVX.
<p>Masternodes may earn more but there is a lot of hassle setting up and running them.
<p>You can estimate earnings with <a href="http://cryptonode.co/">Cryptonode</a>.
<p>The wallet needs to be opened and unlocked while connected to the Internet; so be careful with security.
<p>Addresses need to have at least 100 confirmations.
<p>Crazy Pro Tip - After an address gets 100 confirmations then restart the wallet and unlock it. Then the staking should be active for that balance.
