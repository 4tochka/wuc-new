<p>In this video we focus on price, specifically in the attempt to model the <a href="/price-of-bitcoin-goes-wild-on-etf-decision/">price of Bitcoin</a>. Big investors make price models for assets. Trouble is they keep this information private. Models may not predict the price, but the certainly provide a better understanding. In this video, James walks you through the concepts and challenges of modelling the price of Bitcoin. From velocity, transaction volume, supply, to all the big markets Bitcoin proposes to disrupt (hedge funds, gold, e-commerce, money supply, remittances etc). Better still we walk you through the alpha version of our open-source model.</p>
