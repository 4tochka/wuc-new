<h4>Install a VPN</h4>

<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, allows you to browse the web more securely and most importantly, more privately than if you do not use one. It is particularly useful if you are on a public wifi which is normally full of people trying to hack a way in and take people’s data. </p>

<p>These networks are regularly unsecure and poorly monitored and could turn your trip to the coffee shop with your laptop into a nightmare. A VPN creates a private network within a public one which acts as a shield, almost like a cover, for your browsing session. </p>

<p>As the VPN market is flooded with options,you can find impartial reviews, like at <a href="securethoughts.com/express-vpn-review/">Secure Thoughts VPN Reviews</a> which aims to help you find out whether a certain provider fits your needs. Not only will you learn more about a great VPN but also more about why they are essential to protect you online. They stop other people getting into your private bubble and will lock down any bitcoin activity you engage in while on the web.</p>

<h4>Make Sure Your Antivirus Is Up To Date</h4>

<p>Antivirus software often feels a bit like a net under a tightrope walker, you hope they will never have to use it but you are glad they have it there. A lot of people use antiviruses to protect their computers and they are often very helpful and can give you great peace of mind, especially if they have special programs dedicated to keeping you safe online. </p>

<p>The main thing to keep in mind is you must make sure it is up to date. An out of date antivirus protection is almost worse than having nothing at all. It can have all kinds of holes and bugs that have been ironed out by a new update. So when it pops up on your screen asking to update make sure to say yes right away.</p>
