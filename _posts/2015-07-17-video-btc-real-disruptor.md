<p>Presenting as part of the session <a href="/video-bitcoin-beyond-national-money/">"Beyond Bitcoin, Unleashing the Blockchain"</a>, Andreas M Antonopoulos opens with a contrarian perspective. It's not about "beyond bitcoin", and you can't put this technology on a leash to make it more palatable. Bitcoin is the real thing, the revolutionary and disruptive technology that can't be tamed. Bitcoin is punk rock and you can't turn it into smooth jazz just to satisfy the sensibilities of a timid boardroom.</p>
